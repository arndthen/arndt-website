  I'm a researcher with 7+ years of experience in combining quantiative and qualitative approaches for problem solving and knowledge creation. My background is in psychology and applied linguistics, and I am particularly interested in how our relationships and activities in everyday life shape how we use and learn second languages.

  I have a keen interest in UX research, as I am always looking for opportunities to apply my skills beyond academia. Language learner (user) perspectives have been at the centre of all of my work to date: I try to understand how individuals experience different languages in their everyday lives, with the goal of helping to better bridge the gap between formal and informal learning. My research interests include second language acquisition, language learning motivation and attitudes, engagement, and attention.
