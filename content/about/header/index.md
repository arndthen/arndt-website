I currently work as Postdoctoral Researcher for the research platform Language Acquisition, Multilingualism, and Teaching [LAMiNATE](https://laminate.ht.lu.se/) and the Centre for Languages and Literature at [Lund University](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/henriette-l-arndt). My work primarily concerns the development and validation of research methods in second language acquisition, and with a particular focus on the Experience Sampling Method. I also have expertise in experimental and mixed methods research design, advanced statistical modelling and data visualization.
